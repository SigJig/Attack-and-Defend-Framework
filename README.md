# Attack-and-Defend-Framework

Attack and Defend is a gamemode built off of Gal Zohar's Dynamic Take and Secure (DTAS). Everything in this repository is developed by him, unless stated otherwise in the top comments of the files. 

This branch is the base version of the files. Nothing has been changed by anyone other than the original mission author.
